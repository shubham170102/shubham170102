ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! 

I'm Shubham Shrivastava, a passionate CS and Applied Math Senior @ Purdue University based in West Lafayette, IN, and my hometown in Cary, NC. I have a keen interest in Natural Language Processing (NLP), Deep Learning architecture, Software Automation, and Cloud Computing. I thrive on creating innovative solutions that bridge the gap between technology and user experience.

ðŸ”­ Currently, I'm focused on multiple personal projects and my ongoing research, where I'm leveraging Python, C++, Node.js, PyTorch, and Magpie to build software automating tools for any organization and build modules that can be used for weather prediction modeling.

ðŸ’¬ Feel free to contact me for collaborations, tech discussions, or just for a chat about any topic of interest. Let's connect and make something awesome together!
